### INTERACTION

The way we interact with Bicycle reimagines the relationship between human and machine.

We optimize interaction for efficiency and natural flow. When technology adapts to users, interaction becomes more intuitive and immediate.

Bicycle improves upon traditional input/output paradigms through several integrated approaches:

Intent Processing enables multimodal understanding across voice, gesture, and touch inputs. This system processes user actions efficiently, adapts to usage patterns, and maintains context across different interaction modes.

Reality Integration creates seamless physical-digital experiences. This includes efficient rendering, display optimization, and environmental awareness that extends beyond the screen.

Spatial Computing establishes an intuitive interaction space. The system generates context-aware interfaces and implements space-aware features based on user needs and environmental factors.

Advanced Integration processes multiple input signals to anticipate user needs before explicit actions are needed.

### INPUT

Input in the Bicycle paradigm creates efficient pathways from natural human expression to action, completely reimagining traditional interfaces.

We embrace natural human modalities—from conversational speech to intuitive gestures, from environmental context to social cues. The system processes these natural inputs holistically, understanding the full context of human intention rather than just executing explicit commands.

#### CURRENT METHODS

Bicycle's input systems transcend conventional interfaces by understanding natural human expression.

We recognize the rich complexity of human communication through multiple natural channels. The system processes natural language, physical gestures, environmental context, and social cues - eliminating the need for artificial interface elements or explicit commands.

Bicycle accepts input through natural human channels:

Pattern Recognition understands natural human movement and gestures - not just predefined commands. Contextual Voice Processing comprehends natural speech within its full situational and emotional context.

Environmental Awareness processes the physical space, social dynamics, and user state to understand intent without explicit commands. Adaptive Response learns from natural interaction patterns to anticipate needs before they're expressed.

#### ENVIRONMENT

Bicycle's environmental awareness creates a contextually intelligent system that adapts to its surroundings and the people within them.

We embrace the social, emotional, and intentional dimensions of each environment. The system becomes a participant in the rich tapestry of human contexts, adapting its behavior appropriately to each situation.

The system naturally flows between different contexts, creating a consistent experience regardless of situation:

Device Agnostic design ensures the same experience across all surfaces, from small wearables to room-scale displays. Reality Mixing enables seamless transition between physical and digital realms, blending them into a unified experience.

Context Inheritance draws understanding from environmental factors without explicit configuration or setup. Social Awareness adapts to the presence of others, modifying interaction models based on social context and collaborative needs.

#### PELOTON MODE

Peloton Mode transcends traditional collaboration, creating a neural symphony of collective intelligence. Like cyclists drafting off each other's momentum, teams naturally flow between leading and supporting roles—an organic dance of shared purpose and capability.

Work synchronizes effortlessly as thought patterns align across the group. Knowledge transfers instantly through neural bridges, creating a shared consciousness that preserves creativity while amplifying collective wisdom. Breakthroughs ripple through the network, elevating the entire team.

The system's neural fabric weaves individual strengths into unprecedented capability. Each participant's unique cognitive patterns enrich the whole, creating emergent intelligence beyond the sum of its parts. Like birds moving as one while maintaining agency, the group achieves fluid, dynamic harmony.

This is cognitive symbiosis—where boundaries between individual and collective blur, giving rise to augmented teamwork where every member's potential is fully realized. Peloton Mode represents the evolution of human collaboration, orchestrating a symphony of connected minds.

### OUTPUT

Output in the Bicycle paradigm creates natural, responsive experiences that mirror human perception and understanding.

We engage with humans through natural sensory channels in ways that feel completely intuitive. The system responds through whatever combination of modalities - visual, auditory, haptic, or environmental - best suits the natural flow of interaction.

#### VISUAL

Visual expression in Bicycle represents a fundamental shift away from traditional screen-based interfaces.

We embrace a naturally responsive approach to visual communication. Rather than presenting rigid interfaces with buttons and menus, the system creates fluid visual responses that adapt to natural human behavior, context, and needs.

Bicycle transcends traditional display paradigms:

Natural Response generates visual feedback that feels like a natural extension of human interaction. Contextual Adaptation ensures visual elements emerge and evolve based on natural human behavior and environmental context.

Spatial Understanding allows information to exist naturally in three-dimensional space, moving beyond the constraints of 2D screens. Environmental Integration blends digital responses seamlessly into the physical world.

Cognitive Harmony ensures visual density and complexity naturally match human cognitive state and context, without requiring explicit interface manipulation.

#### NON-VISUAL

Bicycle's non-visual output creates rich sensory experiences that complement and enhance visual information.

We treat multiple output channels as integrated parts of the system. Different forms of feedback are used to convey information in the most effective ways.

Information delivery occurs through multiple channels, creating an enhanced user experience:

Haptic Feedback enables precise communication through touch, conveying information through tactile responses. Spatial Audio generates positioned sound that creates an intuitive auditory dimension to interaction.

Ambient Output provides environmental feedback through connected devices and systems, extending the interface beyond traditional boundaries.
