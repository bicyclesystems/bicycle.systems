Computing was meant to be a bicycle for the mind. Instead, it became a cage.

We don't use computers. We fight them. We dig through files. We open apps. We waste time managing software instead of thinking freely.

Bicycle erases everything that slows us down. No apps. No OS. No files. No browsers. 
Just pure intelligence. Instant execution of thought.

This isn't computing improved. This is computing, reborn.

Are you ready to ride?

🚴💨🔥

## WHAT IF YOUR COMPUTER ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD YOU?

Touch, speak, or move - Bicycle responds instantly. The screen shows exactly what you need, then fades away. As natural as picking up a pen.

We don't make software. We make it disappear.

Want information? Just ask. Need to create? Just start. Want to watch? Just look. Everything flows naturally, like water.

Your screen changes with your needs. No buttons to learn. No menus to dig through. Just you and your ideas, moving at the speed of thought.

This isn't a fancy computer. This is freedom from traditional computers.

## HAVE WE BEEN SOLVING THE WRONG PROBLEM ALL ALONG?

We've spent decades refining the wrong thing. Computers got more powerful, not smarter. AI is bolted onto outdated systems, never as the foundation.

Operating systems were built for weak machines. Apps are a crutch. Files are a relic. Everything about modern computing is a desperate attempt to make an inefficient model seem functional.

Bicycle doesn't refine computing. It erases what never worked.

## WHAT MAKES THIS POSSIBLE NOW?

Three core innovations:

1. Neural-first architecture: A processing engine that understands context, intent, and execution. Unlike traditional systems that bolt AI onto existing software.
2. Dynamic interface generation: Every visual element generated in real-time, optimized for your current thought process. No static UI.
3. Unified knowledge processing: A continuous, intelligent knowledge stream that evolves with your work. Instead of files and apps.

4. Open source foundation: Both software and hardware are open source, designed to re-circulate and become a source for others. We're the assemblers at the frontier, focusing on designs, understanding form factors, and pushing boundaries. We're building a brand that represents the future of computing, one that others can contribute to and evolve.

## SO WHAT IS BICYCLE?

Bicycle is not exactly a computer. It's a fundamentally new relationship between humanity and technology - where machines serve thought, not commands.

We're entering an era where creativity becomes the next frontier. Not just predicting patterns, but imagining new ones. Where human and machine creativity blend to solve problems in ways neither could alone. Where technology conforms to how humans think and create, not the reverse.

BIKE 1.0 is a fundamentally new computing paradigm that eliminates traditional software layers in favor of direct neural processing. Key innovations include:

Neural Intent System
• Understands implicit intent without explicit commands
• Generates UI in real-time based on context
• Maintains persistent state without saving
• Controls hardware directly without abstraction

Neural Core Architecture  
• Quantum-inspired processing substrate
• Direct thought-to-silicon execution
• Parallel neural pathways
• Intelligent memory with predictive caching

BIKE Kernel
• Thought stream management instead of processes
• Neural state management instead of memory
• Knowledge graphs instead of files
• Direct hardware neural interface
• Intent-based execution pipeline

This isn't iterative improvement.
This is computing reborn from first principles.
This is technology that thinks as you think.
This is the future we've been waiting for.

## WHY START WITH EDUCATION WHEN WE COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING?

Why education? $342B global market. Clear pain points. Network effects.

History proves it: The first NeXT Computer targeted education. It gave us the World Wide Web.

Education demands the impossible - the delicate balance of simplicity and complexity. When you solve for education, you solve for humanity.

Students think faster than software. Schools waste millions on licenses. Learning systems create barriers. Research slows with tool switching.

Bicycle eliminates all of it.

Think this:
• reduction in IT costs
• less time spent on software management
• increase in student engagement

Join us: @bicyclesystems

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TECHNOLOGY FINALLY SERVES EDUCATION?

Students: Natural language homework help. Instant research synthesis. Personalized learning paths. Seamless collaboration. Continuous progress tracking.

Teachers: Automated grading with nuanced understanding. Intelligent lesson planning. Deep analytics. On-demand resource creation. Contextual parent communication.

Administration: Automated scheduling. Optimal resource allocation. Background compliance reporting. Predictive budget management. Secure, instant student records.

Freedom to teach and inspire, not manage technology.

## WHEN DESIGN THINKING BECOMES SECOND NATURE

Creativity and design are the keys to solving humanity's greatest challenges. But for too long, they were treated as elective skills. Now they emerge as the fundamental path to real-world impact.

What if students could learn design thinking and live it? Every interaction with Bicycle reinforces creative problem-solving. Every task becomes an opportunity to innovate. Every challenge transforms into a design opportunity.

• Design sprints become daily practice
• Creative confidence builds naturally
• Innovation becomes a mindset, not a class
• Real-world impact starts in the classroom

## WHAT IF DAY ONE FELT LIKE YEAR THREE?

Your first day with Bicycle:
• No migration needed - it understands your existing data
• No training required - it adapts to how you think
• No setup - just start working naturally

Bicycle doesn't replace your tools. It makes them irrelevant.

## HOW DO YOU BUILD WHAT SHOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE?

We move fast. We break everything. We don't ask permission.

1. Lock the identity. Make people curious before showing what's coming.
2. Build the core. No apps. No windows. Just raw intelligence that executes instantly.
3. Train it internally, then with early users. It optimizes its own UI based on real interaction.
4. Tease it. A single video. No explanation. Just a glimpse of something impossible.
5. Secure funding without control. No one owns Bicycle except those who build it.
6. Release it and watch everything change. One moment, the world is normal. The next, Bicycle exists.

## WHAT DOES BACKING THIS LOOK LIKE?

$55M SAFE round. $550M valuation cap. 20% discount. No board seats. No control provisions.

Investment process: Initial contact, due diligence, technical deep dive, term sheet, closing within 2 weeks.

Minimum: $1M. Maximum: $10M per investor.

Strategic capital only. No traditional VC games. Big options pool to attract and retain talent.

## WHO DARES CHALLENGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY?

We're anonymous, but you may know us. We're about to do the unreal. But we're real. We don't seek attention. We know we'll get it. Now, we build.

We're not a technology company. We're a team of designers and engineers building a product that changes how people think.

We take strategic capital from deep-tech investors who want to back the next personal computing revolution. Private funding structures maintain independence.

No traditional VC nonsense. No dilution. Just execution.

## WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

We're assembling an elite team. Currently looking:

Lead Engineer (Technical Visionary):
• Deep expertise in system architecture and scalability

## WHY CAN'T THE GIANTS STOP US?

Big Tech can't disrupt themselves:
• OpenAI/Microsoft: Trapped in Windows. Can't kill what they depend on. Selling AI as service, not a system.
• Apple: Needs the App Store. We eliminate apps entirely. They refine UI, but won't replace it.
• Google: Ad revenue needs the web. We make browsing obsolete. They can't disrupt their own ecosystem.

Business Model Conflict: Would destroy their app stores, eliminate their ad revenue, kill their OS licensing.

They optimize existing systems. We replace them entirely.

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COMPUTING DISAPPEARS?

Bicycle removes the need for software, operating systems, and UI design.

It's a new category of existence - a symbiotic intelligence that thinks with you, not for you.

This is about amplifying human potential, not replacing it.

We don't measure against competitors. We measure against possibility.

## HOW DO WE PROTECT WHAT MATTERS?

Technical: Security audits. Performance testing. Scalability planning beyond conventional limits. Redundant systems that self-heal. Recovery protocols that execute in milliseconds.

Business: Strategic legal structure. Comprehensive insurance. Ironclad contracts. Compliance without compromise. Crisis protocols that turn threats into opportunities.

Open source foundation: Both software and hardware are open source, designed to re-circulate and become a source for others. We're the assemblers at the frontier, focusing on designs, understanding form factors, and pushing boundaries. We're building a brand that represents the future of computing, an ecosystem that others can contribute to and evolve.

## WHAT DOES SUCCESS TRULY LOOK LIKE?

Technical: Sub-second response time. Instant UI generation. 99.999% uptime. Near-zero error rates. Computational efficiency that improves daily.

Business: Exponential user adoption. Customer evangelists. Revenue growth that funds independence. Market dominance, not just share. Brand recognition that transcends technology.

## WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

Year 1: Core launch. First 10 schools. Revenue. Team growth.
Year 2: Market expansion. Enterprise adoption. Hardware development.
Year 3: Global leadership. Purpose-built hardware. Industry dominance.

We don't follow roadmaps. We create new destinations.
