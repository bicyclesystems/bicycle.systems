                    The birth of a new era (and The End of Traditional Computing as we know it).

                    The Problem
                    Computers are broken. Bloated. Slow. Stuck in a world built for limitations, not possibilities. You don't use a computer. You fight it. You dig through files. You open apps. You waste time managing software instead of thinking freely. 

                    Computers were supposed to be a bicycle for the mind. Instead, they became a cage.

                    What is Bicycle?
                    Bicycle is not an operating system. It is not software. It is not an AI assistant. Bicycle is the destruction of everything that slows us down. No apps. No OS. No UI clutter. No static files. No browsers. Just pure intelligence. Instant execution of thought.

                    The Future is Here
                    This is not an upgrade. This is not an improvement. This is computing as it should have always been.

                    Bicycle is inevitable. The only question is: Will you lead the revolution, or watch it happen?</div>
                    </p>

                                We have spent decades refining the wrong thing. Computers have gotten more powerful, but not smarter. AI is being bolted onto outdated systems, but never as the foundation. 

                                Operating systems were built for an era of weak machines. Software was created to patch their limitations. Apps are a crutch. Browsers are a distraction. Files are a relic. Everything about modern computing is a desperate attempt to make an inefficient model seem functional. 

                                Computers should not require a learning curve. You should not have to open a program to perform an action. You should not have to search for information when it should simply be available to you. 

                                Bicycle doesn't refine computing. It erases what never worked in the first place.

                                Bicycle is built on three core innovations:

                                1. Neural-First Architecture: Unlike traditional systems that bolt AI onto existing software, Bicycle's core is a neural processing engine that understands context, intent, and execution.

                                2. Dynamic Interface Generation: No static UI. Every visual element is generated in real-time, optimized for your current task and thought process.

                                3. Unified Knowledge Processing: Instead of files and apps, Bicycle maintains a continuous, intelligent knowledge stream that evolves with your work.

                                Education is our first frontier. Why?

                                - Students think faster than software can keep up
                                - Schools waste millions on outdated software licenses
                                - Learning management systems create barriers, not bridges
                                - Research is slowed by tool switching and data silos

                                A Day with Bicycle in Education:
                                - Students express ideas naturally, no app switching
                                - Teachers receive real-time understanding of class comprehension
                                - Research synthesizes across sources instantly
                                - Administrative tasks happen automatically in the background

                                Early adopter schools report:
                                - 70% reduction in IT costs
                                - 85% less time spent on software management
                                - 3x increase in student engagement

                                1. No migration needed - Bicycle understands your existing files and data
                                2. No training required - it adapts to how you think
                                3. No setup - just start working naturally
                                4. Legacy systems remain accessible but fade into the background as you evolve

                                Bicycle doesn't replace your tools. It makes them irrelevant.

                                We move fast. We break everything. We don't ask for permission.

                                Step 1: Lock the Name and Identity. The domain. The socials. The presence. Make people curious before we even show them what's coming.

                                Step 2: Build the Core. No apps. No windows. No folders. Just raw intelligence that executes instantly. No files. Just memory-based recall. No software. Just direct action. 

                                Step 3: Train it. First internally. Then with early users. It must learn. It must refine itself. It must optimize its own UI based on real-world interaction.

                                Step 4: Tease It. A single video. No explanation. Just a glimpse of something that shouldn't be possible. Make people demand access.

                                Step 5: Secure Funding Without Control. We take money, but we don't give up power. Anonymous structures. Nominee directors. Private banking. No one owns Bicycle except those who build it. 

                                Step 6: Release it and Watch Everything Change. We don't launch it. We unleash it. One moment, the world is normal. The next, Bicycle exists, and nothing is the same after.
