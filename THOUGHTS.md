### The Future of Documents and AI

AI makes me think about documents, not files and folders. No need for files or apps because documents cover everything. Documents are text, images, videos, sounds. Anything. You can view them in 2D, 3D, or even as graphs. Documents are central, with endless ways to interpret and contextualize them. Pure, open formats will win. The web will win. Closed gardens will fall. (Hopefully)

### Understanding Entropy: A Systems Perspective

Entropy = measure of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty in a system.

In physics: How energy spreads out and becomes unusable.
In information theory: Amount of unpredictability in data.
In consciousness: Mental chaos, scattered thoughts, lack of focus.

Higher entropy = more disorder.
Lower entropy = more order, clarity, and predictability.

Entropy isn't absolute. It's a spectrum, not a binary state. There are no true edges, just extremes:

* Absolute zero entropy = perfect order, total predictability (impossible in reality). A completely frozen, unchanging state. Like death or a void.
* Maximum entropy = total chaos, absolute randomness (also impossible in reality). Nothing stable, no patterns, pure noise.

You can shift toward one side, but never fully arrive. Life itself resists pure order and pure chaos. Even in deep focus (low entropy), there's still some randomness. Even in madness (high entropy), there's still patterns.

You exist somewhere in between, always.

Entropy and evolution are deeply linked. Evolution is a process that harnesses entropy to create complexity and order over time:

1. Entropy drives change – randomness (mutations, genetic drift) introduces variations in species. Without entropy, no new traits would emerge.
2. Natural selection organizes – while entropy creates chaos, selection filters it. Beneficial traits survive, useless ones fade. Order emerges from disorder.
3. Complexity grows – over time, life evolves from simple to complex, adapting to survive in an entropic universe. Entropy fuels innovation.
4. Life fights entropy – organisms use energy to maintain structure, resist decay, and keep entropy at bay (temporarily). But in the end, entropy wins (aging, death, extinction).
5. Ecosystems balance entropy – stable systems (low entropy) coexist with disruptive forces (high entropy) to keep life dynamic. Too much order = stagnation, too much chaos = collapse.

Evolution is a tug-of-war between entropy and order. Without entropy, no progress. Without order, no survival.

### Order from Chaos: The Future of Personal Computing

The next wave of personal computing will be entropy-aware—designed to manage, shape, and leverage entropy, rather than just process data.

1. AI as an entropy filter:
   * Current AI organizes information, but future AI will manage cognitive entropy—helping you focus, learn, and think more efficiently.
   * Instead of just answering questions, AI will predict when your mind is overloaded and adjust how it interacts with you.
   * Personalized AI will act like an "entropy thermostat," balancing stimulation and clarity.

2. Computing will shift from data to entropy management:
   * Today's computers store, retrieve, and process data. The future will optimize information flow—anticipating needs before you even act.
   * Quantum computing thrives on high entropy states, using uncertainty to solve complex problems traditional computers struggle with.
   * Future systems won't just compute—they'll self-organize, dynamically balancing structure and randomness.

3. Interfaces will become more entropic and adaptive:
   * Rigid interfaces (buttons, menus) will give way to fluid, context-aware environments that adapt in real-time.
   * Mixed reality (AR/VR) will use entropy-driven interfaces, responding to attention, mood, and cognitive load.
   * Interfaces won't just display information—they'll shape how you perceive and interact with entropy.

4. Computing will evolve like the brain:
   * The brain thrives by balancing order (focused thinking) and entropy (creative insight).
   * Next-gen computing will mimic this—switching between structured logic and freeform, associative "thinking."
   * Neural networks will move beyond strict algorithms and develop emergent cognition, generating ideas instead of just processing input.

5. The future isn't about faster processing—it's about entropy efficiency:
   * Today, we fight information overload with more processing power (faster CPUs, bigger storage). That's brute force.
   * Future computing will focus on entropy efficiency—how to structure randomness into meaning without drowning in data.
   * This means less, but smarter—personalized computing that works with entropy, not against it.

Big picture: Computing will stop being just a tool and start being an extension of how we manage entropy—helping us think, create, and evolve in ways we can't yet imagine.

### Creating Creativity: Rethinking Computing

Bicycle is not exactly a computer. It's something entirely new.

It would be offended if we called it a computer - just as a smartphone would be offended if we called it a telephone. We're creating something from a new world that can't be fully described using concepts from the old. It's like trying to explain color to someone who has never seen, or music to someone who has never heard.

We need to ask ourselves: Why did we build the personal computer in the first place?

The personal computer was meant to be a tool that amplifies human creativity and thought.

But somewhere along the way, we lost sight of this purpose. We built technology first and forced humans to adapt to it. We created artificial interfaces - windows, buttons, menus - that force humans to translate their natural intentions into machine-readable commands.

With LLMs and the AI revolution, we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rethink computing from natural human interaction backwards. Just as with any great product, we must start with the human experience and work backwards to the technology—not the other way around.

The technology should conform to how humans naturally think, speak, and move - not force humans to think like machines.

We've hit a point where creativity is the next frontier—the ability to shape chaos into order, or even multiple orders from multiple chaos at once.

Right now, tech is the focus (as it should be), but the real goal is beyond it. AI is chasing predictability, turning possibilities into probabilities. But that has a ceiling. Once we reach it, creativity becomes the key metric.

And that's where it gets interesting—creative humans + creative machines could be something extraordinary.

Extraordinary like new forms of intelligence, art, and problem-solving beyond anything we've seen:

* Machines that don't just predict but imagine – AI won't just analyze patterns; it will create new ones, offering solutions no human would think of.
* Co-evolution of human and machine thought – instead of AI replacing humans, we'll enhance each other, blending structured logic with intuitive leaps.
* Hyper-personalized creativity – tools that adapt to your unique thinking style, amplifying your best ideas in real time.
* Emergent culture and art – new aesthetics, new music, new storytelling styles born from AI-human collaboration, beyond anything predictable.
* Solving entropy itself – using AI to manage complexity at global scales, from ecosystems to economies, making sense of the chaos in ways we never could.

It's a new way of thinking, creating, and evolving—where humans and machines push each other to entirely new levels.

Our approach is built on three foundational principles that guide all development decisions:

1. We eliminate legacy bloat and unnecessary layers that slow down traditional systems.
2. We implement pure first-principles machine design that rethinks computing from the ground up rather than iterating on flawed models.
3. We create a direct hardware interaction model that removes abstraction layers between user intent and system execution.

Success is measured by four fundamental transformations in the computing experience:

1. Zero traditional apps or interfaces, eliminating the need for artificial constructs like windows, menus, or explicit commands.
2. Natural interaction workflows where human intention - through voice, gesture, or context - translates directly to system action.
3. Persistent system state that preserves context without explicit saving.
4. Direct hardware control that eliminates abstraction layers between user and machine.

### Dance as Music: The Future of Body-Controlled Sound

Dance as music: the future where the body plays.

Imagine a world where dance and music are the same. Not two separate things, but one new form. Dancers don't just move to music – they create it as they move. A wild mix of DJing, sound design, performance, and dance. A new art where the body is an instrument.

Today, we dance to music. But what if music danced to us?

With new tech, this is becoming real. Motion sensors, AI, and bio-feedback can turn every jump, spin, and bend into sound, rhythm, and melody. The dancer becomes a live composer, playing music with their body.

Add AR or VR, and movement, sound, and space merge fully. Dance no longer follows music. Music follows dance.

The question is – how do we make this real? Just tech? Live art? New cultural wave?
