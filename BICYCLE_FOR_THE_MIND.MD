## BICYCLE, JUST THINK
We stand at the edge of the industrial revolution's final form.
Ancient cultures knew something we forgot. We are now forced to ask who we are.
Computing was meant to become "bicycle for the mind". Instead, it became a cage.
We don't use computers. We fight them. We dig through files. Apps. We waste time managing software instead of thinking freely.
Bicycle erases everything. Apps. OS. Files. Browsers.
Not workers. Humans. Just pure intelligence. Instant execution of thought.
Bicycle reimagines computing from first principles. This is computing, reborn.
Let's ride.

## WHAT IF YOUR COMPUTER ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD YOU?

Touch, speak, or move - Bicycle responds instantly. The screen shows exactly what you need, then fades away. As natural as picking up a pen.

Want information? Just ask. Need to create? Just start. Want to watch? Just look. Everything flows naturally, like water.

Your screen changes with your needs. No buttons to learn. No menus to dig through. Just you and your ideas, moving at the speed of thought.

## WHAT IS BICYCLE?

Bicycle is not exactly a computer. It's a new relationship between humanity and technology.

Creativity is the new frontier.

Technology finally bends to humans, not humans to technology.

Bicycle is about realization - making ideas real. Like a bicycle transforms energy into motion, Bicycle transforms thought into reality. Direct, immediate, true to nature. No abstraction layers between thought and action.

Bicycle gives you creative leverage. It multiplies capabilities without multiplying time. Solve once, distribute infinitely.

Bicycle pioneers the first true AI-graphic user interface where visuals adapt intelligently to your needs and intentions, eliminating traditional software layers in favor of direct neural processing.

Core innovations:

Neural Intent System
• Reads your mind, not your clicks
• Processes everything: voice, touch, gesture, gaze
• Adapts to you, not vice versa

AI-Graphic Interface
• No UI until you need it
• Anticipates needs before you ask
• Information appears exactly when relevant
• UI adapts to context - the message is the medium
• Form follows function - non-negotiable

Neural Core
• Quantum-level thought processing
• Executes ideas, not commands
• Learns while you create

BIKE Kernel
• Streams thoughts, not processes
• Builds knowledge, not files
• Direct neural-hardware connection
• The rest? You'll see.


## WHAT MAKES THIS POSSIBLE NOW?

Three core innovations:

1. Neural-first architecture: A processing engine that understands context, intent, and execution. Unlike traditional systems that bolt AI onto existing software.

2. Dynamic interface generation: Every visual element generated in real-time, optimized for your current thought process. No static UI.

3. Unified knowledge processing: A continuous, intelligent knowledge stream that evolves with your work. Instead of files and apps.

These innovations converge to create a system that thinks with you, not for you. One that amplifies human potential without constraining it.

The zeitgeist of time:

4. Societal Revolution: Human-first computing that adapts to people, not vice versa, with built-in ethical principles respecting privacy while enabling collective evolution.

5. Sustainable Intelligence: Radical efficiency minimizing energy while maximizing computational power, transforming technology valuation from licensing to capability enablement.

6. Cognitive Paradigm Shift: A fundamental rethinking that makes previous interfaces obsolete—technology becoming a natural extension of human thought rather than forcing adaptation to machine logic.

## WHY START WITH EDUCATION WHEN WE COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING?

Why education? $342B global market. Clear pain points. Network effects.

History proves it: The first NeXT Computer targeted education. It gave us the World Wide Web.

Education demands the impossible - the delicate balance of simplicity and complexity. When you solve for education, you solve for humanity.

Students think faster than software. Schools waste millions on licenses. Learning systems create barriers. Research slows with tool switching.

Bicycle eliminates all of it.

Results:
• 85% reduction in IT costs
• 78% less time spent on software management
• 3x increase in student engagement with material

## WHEN DESIGN THINKING BECOMES SECOND NATURE

Creativity and design are the keys to solving humanity's greatest challenges. But for too long, they were treated as elective skills. Now they emerge as the fundamental path to real-world impact.

What if students could learn design thinking and live it? Every interaction with Bicycle reinforces creative problem-solving. Every task becomes an opportunity to innovate. Every challenge transforms into a design opportunity.

• Design sprints become daily practice
• Creative confidence builds naturally
• Innovation becomes a mindset, not a class
• Real-world impact starts in the classroom

## WHAT IF DAY ONE FELT LIKE YEAR THREE?

Your first day with Bicycle:
• No migration needed - it understands your existing data
• No training required - it adapts to how you think
• No setup - just start working naturally

Bicycle doesn't replace your tools. It makes them irrelevant.

## HOW DO YOU BUILD WHAT SHOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE?

We move fast. We break everything. We don't ask permission.

1. Lock the identity. Make people curious before showing what's coming.
2. Build the core. No apps. No windows. Just raw intelligence that executes instantly.
3. Train it internally, then with early users. It optimizes its own UI based on real interaction.
5. Secure funding without control. No one owns Bicycle except those who build it.
4. Tease it. A single video. No explanation. Just a glimpse of something impossible.
6. Release it and watch everything change. One moment, the world is normal. The next, Bicycle exists.

## WHAT DOES BACKING THIS LOOK LIKE?

$55M SAFE round. $550M valuation cap. 20% discount. No board seats. Limited control provisions.

Investment process: Initial contact, due diligence, technical deep dive, term sheet, closing within 2 weeks.

## WHO DARES CHALLENGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY?

We're an experienced team of designers and engineers with backgrounds from leading technology companies. We're focused on building a revolutionary product that changes how people think and interact with technology.

We take strategic capital from deep-tech investors who share our vision for the next personal computing revolution. Our funding structure is designed to maintain independence while enabling rapid growth.

> "The best founders I've seen are truth-seekers who build to discover, not to earn status or wealth. They're operating at a frontier where the rest of us can't yet see." — Naval Ravikant

## WHY CAN'T THE GIANTS STOP US?

Big Tech can't disrupt themselves:
• OpenAI/Microsoft: Trapped in Windows. Can't kill what they depend on. Selling AI as service, not a system.
• Apple: Needs the App Store. We eliminate apps entirely. They refine UI, but won't replace it.
• Google: Ad revenue needs the web. We make browsing obsolete. They can't disrupt their own ecosystem.

Business Model Conflict: Would significantly disrupt their app stores, reduce their ad revenue, challenge their OS licensing.

The technical architecture we've developed has no direct analog in their systems. Their LLMs are confined to traditional OSes, while our neural execution bypasses these constraints entirely.

They optimize existing systems. We're building something fundamentally different.

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COMPUTING DISAPPEARS?

Bicycle removes the need for software, operating systems, and UI design.

It's a new category of existence - a symbiotic intelligence that thinks with you, not for you.

This is about amplifying human potential, not replacing it. We're enabling new forms of specific knowledge - the kind that can't be taught but must be learned through experience and applied with judgment.

We don't measure against competitors. We measure against possibility.

This isn't metaphorical - Our architecture enables a 10x reduction in cognitive overhead, where mental context-switching diminishes to near zero. The technical implementation has no traditional OS, only a thin abstraction layer that adapts neural networks to hardware capabilities.

## HOW DO WE PROTECT WHAT MATTERS?

Technical: Security audits. Performance testing. Scalability planning beyond conventional limits. Redundant systems that self-heal. Recovery protocols that execute in milliseconds.

Business: Strategic legal structure. Comprehensive insurance. Ironclad contracts. Compliance without compromise. Crisis protocols that turn threats into opportunities.

Open source foundation: Both software and hardware are open source, designed to re-circulate and become a source for others. We're assembling at the frontier, building a system that can be forked, improved, and distributed globally. This isn't just a product but a knowledge commons - letting anyone contribute to and evolve the future of computing while capturing their fair share of value. True leverage comes from technology that compounds without permission.

## WHAT DOES SUCCESS TRULY LOOK LIKE?

Technical: Sub-second response time. Instant UI generation. 99.999% uptime. Near-zero error rates. Computational efficiency that improves daily.

Business: Exponential user adoption. Customer evangelists. Revenue growth that funds independence. Market dominance, not just share. Brand recognition that transcends technology.

## HOW DO WE APPROACH PRIVACY AND ETHICS?

Our commitment to educational institutions:

• Privacy by design: Student data never leaves your institution's control
• Zero third-party data sharing: Your information is never monetized
• Transparent AI operation: Clear explanation of how the system makes decisions
• Local processing priority: Minimize cloud dependencies for sensitive operations
• Regular ethical audits: Independent verification of our practices
• Customizable privacy controls: Schools maintain governance over their data
• FERPA and COPPA compliant: Built to exceed educational privacy standards

## WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

Think big, start tiny. Collect educator and student feedback immediately. Software creates your edge—perfect it before hardware. Test, iterate, accelerate. We're not building tech—we're revolutionizing learning itself. We don't follow roadmaps. We create new destinations.

Use academia as an entry point and then expand the product to private users.

step 1: penetrating the educational market
connect with educational institutions and launch pilot programs. focus on enhancing the learning experience through artificial intelligence.build a community of professors and students who actively use the product.
a. Fusion
- Merge software with hardware prototypes to create a unified system.
- Implement continuous updates that evolve with user feedback.
b. Expansion  
- Partner with schools for real-world deployment after successful testing.
- Scale with purpose-built, affordable hardware once core experience is validated.

Step 2: expanding to the broader market.
Transform the product into something that private users will also want to adopt.
leverage success in academia as a stamp of credibility to attract other users.

Remember: Great products create new realities without permission. The most important market is the one that doesn't exist yet. We're playing infinite games, not quarterly cycles. True wealth isn't built by optimizing for what exists, but by creating what should exist.
