# BICYCLE: Your AI-Powered Personal Computer

Bicycle is a revolutionary computing platform that transforms how you interact with technology. It's designed to be intuitive, powerful, and deeply personal.

Bicycle is about making ideas real. Like a bicycle transforms energy into motion, Bicycle transforms your thoughts into reality. Direct, immediate, and natural - with no barriers between what you think and what you can create.

## Philosophy: "Start lean, move fast, and own the future"

Bicycle aims to reimagine computing by building incrementally, testing in real environments, and scaling thoughtfully as the technology and market mature. Our vision is to create a system that adapts to human thought patterns rather than forcing humans to adapt to computer logic.
