# BICYCLE: AI-Native Educational Computer

Bicycle is an AI-native computer designed specifically for education that fundamentally transforms how students and teachers interact with technology.

Bicycle is about realization - making ideas real. Like a bicycle transforms energy into motion, Bicycle transforms thought into reality. Direct, immediate, true to nature. No abstraction layers between thought and action.

### Key Principles
- Replacing traditional file systems with a fluid, contextual system where AI automatically organizes all content
- Simplicity with depth - "Low floor, high ceiling" approach to accessibility and capability
- Context-driven experience - Context built from multiple sources: audio, 360° camera, 2D/3D environments, browser frames
- Dynamic interfaces - Content defines UI appearance and behavior, adapting in real-time
- Redefined human-machine relationship - New boundaries with greater creative freedom
- Sensory interfaces - Our interfaces need senses: see, hear, talk, show - sensing is realizing
- Realization through sensing - Direct perception and interaction without abstraction layers
- Critical Thinking First - Every interaction designed to foster analytical and evaluative thinking

### Core Experience
- No files, no apps, no menus, no folders—just AI-powered learning experiences
- One input box where students use voice or natural interaction to express what they want
- Students ask, explore, and create without system management
- Seamless transitions between 2D and 3D environments based on content needs
- Critical thinking embedded in every learning interaction

## User Experience Design

### Conversation Flow Visualization
- Interactive timeline-based navigation through educational content
- Dynamic participant profiles showing active participants in each context
- Event and location-based filtering for focused learning experiences
- Playback controls with adjustable speed for flexible pacing
- Visual distinction between different participant types (teacher, student, remote student)
- Critical thinking components embedded within conversation flows
- Remote student interactions with location context

### Teacher Workflow
- Organize lessons in a "Time & Space" calendar-like structure
- Insert or generate texts, images, videos, and other multimedia content
- AI dynamically generates new, relevant content during lessons
- Real-time adaptation based on student interactions and questions
- Orchestrate classroom screen displays and transitions
- Manage multi-screen coordination for different learning zones
- Configure screen layouts for various teaching modes

### Student Experience
- Natural interaction through voice, hands, and facial expressions
- Content automatically organized by context and relevance
- Revisit lesson content with AI-enhanced exploration tools
- Personalized learning with real-time AI feedback and adaptive content
- Seamless interaction with classroom screens through natural gestures
- Dynamic content adaptation based on screen position and viewing angle
